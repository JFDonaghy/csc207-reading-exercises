1. Entering the loop:
When we first enter the loop, we choose the initial value to be the first
element of the array because the first element is the greatest value so far.

2. At the end of iteration of the loop
We compare an element in the array to our stored maximum value and store
the greater value in ret.

3. After execution:
The greatest value in the array is stored in ret.
